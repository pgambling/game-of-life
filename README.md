# Conway's Game of Life

I randomly decided to implement Conway's Game of Life in React + TS + Canvas. I tried to implement this A LONG time ago and the performance was terrible. I was using direct DOM maniupulation to render the cells at the time. No surprise, canvas is much more performant for this kind of thing.

- Press spacebar to start and stop the game.
- Toggle a cell between alive and dead by clicking on it.
